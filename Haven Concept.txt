Haven Concept.

Include three bars, food (constantly going down, lose if 0), beds (cannot accept villagers if lacking), healthcare (if not proportionate, villagers will slowly die).

Big minesweeper field, the goal is to achieve a thriving city of 500 villagers. 1/3 side view of the game will be the village slowly growing as villagers join in. Tiles can either contain:
[-] Villagers (neighbours indicate sum of all surrounding villagers).
[-] Housing (three tiers, 5 beds, 10 beds, 30 beds).
[-] Food (slowly going down, always replenishes bar that grows proportionate to villager amount).
[-] Healthcare workers (can be none, villagers might slowly die out until goal is unreachable, need to be 2% of people to stay stable.

Consider:
Adding time (day/night), unique indicators to villagers which can die out of age, sickness, starvation, and new children being born during food surplus or bed surplus.
NOTE: might be needed, as a tile press would then for example skip 1.1 days further, so that users get punished for pressing tiles too fast (as hunger goes down).

Adding scouts, can be found on the map, which clear out nearest 3 non-villager tiles to collect.
